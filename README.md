# happiness-project

A project I completed for an in-class final assignment. We were given a dataset that contained many missing values and NAs. The dataset itself comprised of indicators of happiness and a quantifiable happiness level. We implemented various linear regression model, transformation, data cleaning techniques and successfully identified the most significant predictors of happiness.
